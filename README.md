# Global Terrorism Analysis and Severity Prediction

This project explores patterns in global terrorism incidents and uses machine learning to predict the severity of attacks. The analysis is based on the **Global Terrorism Database (GTD)**.

## 📊 Project Overview

- Performed **EDA** (Exploratory Data Analysis) on over 30,000 records
- Visualized attack types, regions, target categories, and weapons used
- Trained an **ML model to predict attack severity** based on features like location, weapon, group, and target type
- Tools Used: `Python`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Scikit-learn`

## 🧠 Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed messy real-world terrorism data
- Visualized impactful trends over time and across geographies
- Built a **classification model** to categorize severity (Low, Medium, High)
- Feature importance and model evaluation included

## 📁 Files & Structure

- `Global_Terrorism_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with full analysis and model
- `data/`: (Optional) Raw or cleaned dataset folder
- `visuals/`: Charts and graphs generated from the notebook
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python packages
- `.gitignore`: To ignore large files (like raw datasets)

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
